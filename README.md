# Cancer Health Disparities through a genomic epidemiology lens

### Outline
(in progress)

1. select cancer (TCGA-COAD is colon)
2. pull TCGA data (gene expression and CNV) (TCGA) and metadata (ancestry) (TCGAA)
3. stratify by ancestry and produce summary statistics
4. ??? differential analyses ???
  * DEG in tumor vs healthy tissue in all patients
  * DEG in tumor vs healthy tissue by ethnicity / race
5. Gene set enrichment analysis for pathways of DEG
6. ??? outcome analyses ???
  * DEG versus 5-year survival in all patients
  * DEG versus 5-year survival by ethnicity / race
7. stratify analysis by all genes, genes overlapping clinical tests
  * measure how much information each gene adds to outcomes in a by-ancestry manner
